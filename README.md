<h3> JUSTWEATHER JUSTWEATHER JUSTWEATHER </h3>

App shows actual temperature and weather in user's current location. That's it!
<br><br>


<h2> "IDEA" </h2>

I wanted to create a modern and avant-garde looking app for the simple purpose of checking the current weather. The development process was really fun and flexible, as I didn't have a predetermined form. In addition to the crazy design, I learned new technologies along the way. The final product may not appeal to everyone, but at least you won't forget it so quickly!
